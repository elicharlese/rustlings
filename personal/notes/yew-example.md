# Yew Example

Yes, I can help you create a Rust program that utilizes the Yew framework to build a front-end interface.

First, we need to make sure that Yew is properly installed in your Rust environment. You can do this by adding the following dependencies to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
yew = "0.18.0"
yew-macro = "0.18.0"
```

Then, we will create a new Rust file, let's call it main.rs, and add the necessary imports for our Yew library:

```rust
use yew::{html, Component, ComponentLink, Html, ShouldRender};
```

Next, we will define a new struct that acts as our main component:

```rust
struct Model {}

impl Component for Model {
    type Message = ();
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_: Self::Properties, _: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Model {}
    }

    fn update(&mut self, _: Self::Message) -> ShouldRender {
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _: Self::Properties) -> ShouldRender {
        false
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        html! {
            // Add your HTML code here
        }
    }
}
```

In this block of code, we have created our Model struct that acts as our main component. We specify the Message and Properties types as () since we don't require any message passing or property inputs for this example.

The create function sets up the component with necessary initialization, while the update function can be used to handle incoming messages (for now, weâ€™ll leave it unimplemented with unimplemented!). The change function is called whenever our properties are changed, and finally the view function returns our actual HTML output for rendering.

Next, we would add the actual HTML code that you want to display in your web application within the view function:

```rust
fn view(&self) -> Html {
  html! {
    <div>
      <p>{"Hello world!"}</p>
      // Add your additional HTML code here
    </div>
  }
}
```

This is just an example code to display "Hello world!", but you can add additional tags and structure as needed for your application.

Finally, in order to actually run the application, we need to instantiate the component and mount it to the webpage:

```rust
fn main() {
  yew::start_app::<Model>();
}
```

This should start a simple Yew web application which displays "Hello world!" on the webpage. From here, you can expand on this foundation and begin building a rich interactive web application using the full capabilities of Yew.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Sure, I can help you build a component for authenticating users using Single Sign-On (SSO) in Rust with Yew.

First, we need to define an interface to interact with the SSO provider. There are usually two main things we need to consider:

User Authentication Endpoint: This endpoint will be used for redirecting unauthenticated users to the SSO login page, where they can enter their credentials.Typically, we must supply some information to this endpoint, eg. Client ID and secret or metadata.

Callback Endpoint: After authentication is successful or otherwise, your application must have a callback endpoint where the SSO service redirects the user's browser with necessary information like tokens, session data, Etc., that needs to be verified by your code before allowing access to protected resources.

Here is a skeleton code for such a Yew Component:

```rust
use yew::{html, Component, ComponentLink, Html};
use yew::services::storage::{Area, StorageService};
use yew::web_sys::Url;

const USER_DATA_KEY: &str = "sso-authData";

pub struct SSOAuthComponent {
    storage: StorageService,
    auth_info: Option<SSOAuthInfo>,
    link: ComponentLink<Self>,
}

pub enum Msg {
    Authorized(SSOAuthResult),
    Unauthorized(String),
}

pub struct SSOAuthInfo {
    pub sso_url: String,
    pub client_id: String,
    pub redirect_uri: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]
pub struct SSOAuthResult {
    // Auth-related fields received from SSO like token ,User Info, Expires_in etc.
}

impl Default for SSOAuthComponent {
    fn default() -> Self {
        let storage = StorageService::new(Area::Session).unwrap();
        let auth_info = storage.restore(USER_DATA_KEY).ok().flatten().and_then(|data| serde_json::from_str::<SSOAuthInfo>(&data).ok());

        Self { storage, auth_info, link: Default::default() }
    }
}

impl Component for SSOAuthComponent {
    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_props: Self::Properties, link: ComponentLink<Self>) -> Self {
        Self::default()
    }

    fn update(&mut self, msg: Self::Message) -> bool {
        match msg {
            Msg::Authorized(result) => {
                // Your code here on successful Auth with SSO provider
                true
            }
            Msg::Unauthorized(err_msg) => {
                // handle unauthorized errors
                false
            }
        }
    }

    fn change(&mut self, _props: Self::Properties) -> bool {
        unimplemented!()
    }

    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        // redirect logic
        if let Some(auth_info) = &self.auth_info {
            let url = Url::new(&auth_info.sso_url);
            url.search_params().set("client_id", &auth_info.client_id);
            url.search_params().set("redirect_uri", &auth_info.redirect_uri);
            url.search_params().set("response_type", "code");
            html! {
                <div>
                    <a href={url.href()}>{ "Login with SSO" }</a>
                </div>
            }
        } else {
            html! { <div> { "Please specify your SSO Configurations." } </div>}
        }
    }
}
```

In summary, the above component is created to render a hyperlink that triggers the redirect process to SSO login page. Once the user logs in successfully and returns to our web app at the callback uri, it retrieves necessary information related to authentication after validation of the token, which in turn results in the Authorized message to be sent along with the auth result to the parent component of SSOAuthComponent for handling it accordingly.
