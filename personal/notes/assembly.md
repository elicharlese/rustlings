# WASM, MASM, TASM, and NASM are all different assembly languages used for programming. Here is a brief explanation of each:

WASM (WebAssembly):
WebAssembly is a binary format that allows developers to write code in languages other than JavaScript (like C or C++) and run that code in the browser. It is not technically an assembly language, but rather a virtual instruction set that can be used with a variety of languages. It is used mainly for web applications.

MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler):
MASM is a high-level assembly language developed by Microsoft for the x86 and x64 architectures. It is primarily used for creating applications for Windows operating systems.

TASM (Turbo Assembler):
TASM is an assembly language developed by Borland for the x86 architecture. It was originally designed for use with DOS-based systems but has also been used for other platforms. It is no longer actively developed or supported.

NASM (Netwide Assembler):
NASM is a portable assembler that supports a variety of instruction sets, including x86, x86-64, and ARM. It is widely used on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, as well as on Windows. NASM is open-source and actively maintained.

In summary, WASM is not an assembly language but rather a virtual instruction set, while MASM, TASM, and NASM are all specific assembly languages used for programming on different platforms.
