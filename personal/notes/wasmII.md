# Announcing Docker+Wasm Technical Preview 2

We recently announced the first Technical Preview of Docker+Wasm, a special build that makes it possible to run Wasm containers with Docker using the WasmEdge runtime. Starting from version 4.15, everyone can try out the features by activating the containerd image store experimental feature.

We didnâ€™t want to stop there, however. Since October, weâ€™ve been working with our partners to make running Wasm workloads with Docker easier and to support more runtimes.

Now we are excited to announce a new Technical Preview of Docker+Wasm with the following three new runtimes:

spin from Fermyon
slight from Deislabs
wasmtime from Bytecode Alliance
All of these runtimes, including WasmEdge, use the runwasi library.

## What is runwasi?

Runwasi is a multi-company effort to make a library in Rust that makes it easier to write containerd shims for Wasm workloads. Last December, the runwasi project was donated and moved to the Cloud Native Computing Foundationâ€™s containerd organization in GitHub.

With a lot of work from people at Microsoft, Second State, Docker, and others, we now have enough features in runwasi to run Wasm containers with Docker or in a Kubernetes cluster. We still have a lot of work to do, but there are enough features for people to start testing.

If you would like to chat with us or other runwasi maintainers, join us on the CNCFâ€™s #runwasi channel.

## Get the update

Ready to dive in and try it for yourself? Great! Before you do, understand that this is a technical preview build of Docker Desktop, so things might not work as expected. Be sure to back up your containers and images before proceeding.

Download and install the appropriate version for your system, then activate the containerd image store (Settings > Features in development > Use containerd for pulling and storing images), and youâ€™ll be ready to go.

## Letâ€™s take Wasm for a spin

The WasmEdge runtime is still present in Docker Desktop, so you can run:

```bash
$ docker run --rm --runtime=io.containerd.wasmedge.v1
--platform=wasi/wasm secondstate/rust-example-hello:latest
Hello WasmEdge!
```

You can even run the same image with the wasmtime runtime:

```bash
$ docker run --rm --runtime=io.containerd.wasmtime.v1
--platform=wasi/wasm secondstate/rust-example-hello:latest
Hello WasmEdge!
```

In the next example, we will deploy a Wasm workload to Docker Desktopâ€™s Kubernetes cluster using the slight runtime. To begin, make sure to activate Kubernetes in Docker Desktopâ€™s settings, then create an example.yaml file:

```bash
cat > example.yaml <<EOT
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: wasm-slight
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wasm-slight
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: wasm-slight
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: wasmtime-slight-v1
      containers:
        - name: hello-slight
          image: dockersamples/slight-rust-hello:latest
          command: ["/"]
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 10m
              memory: 10Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 500m
              memory: 128Mi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: wasm-slight
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: wasm-slight
EOT
```

Note the runtimeClassName, kubernetes will use this to select the right runtime for your application.

You can now run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f example.yaml
```

Once Kubernetes has downloaded the image and started the container, you should be able to curl it:

```bash
$ curl localhost/hello
hello
```

You now have a Wasm container running locally in Kubernetes. How exciting! ðŸŽ‰

Note: You can take this same yaml file and run it in AKS.

Now letâ€™s see how we can use this to run Bartholomew. Bartholomew is a micro-CMS made by Fermyon that works with the spin runtime. Youâ€™ll need to clone this repository; itâ€™s a slightly modified Bartholomew template.

The repository already contains a Dockerfile that you can use to build the Wasm container:

```bash
FROM scratch
COPY . .
ENTRYPOINT [ "/modules/bartholomew.wasm" ]
```

The Dockerfile copies all the contents of the repository to the image and defines the build bartholomew Wasm module as the entry point of the image.

```bash
$ cd docker-wasm-bartholomew
$ docker build -t my-cms .

 ```

You are now ready to run your first WebAssembly micro-CMS:

```bash
docker run --runtime=io.containerd.spin.v1 -p 3000:80 my-cms
```

If you go to <http://localhost:3000>, you should be able to see the Bartholomew landing page (Figure 2).
