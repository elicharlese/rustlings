fn main() {
    // let x = 5;
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");

}
// You are not allowed to use mut with constants; they're always immutable
// Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words.
// Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code.
